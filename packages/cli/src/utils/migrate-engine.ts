// registry, the version-window selection logic, the topological sort that orders
// targets deps-before-dependents, and the pure plan assembly. The command layer
// (commands/migrate.ts) and the IO layer (utils/migrate-runner.ts) handle disk
// access; this file only transforms in-memory data.
//
// `semver` is a normal value import (already a dependency). No mutation of any
// input is ever performed — every transform returns a fresh object.
